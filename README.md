# KittyPaw

This is my Test App, that allows the user to get the list and the details of cat breeds that are present in the API.

## Screens

The app has 4 different screens:
1. Main screen
2. RandomKitty
3. KittyList
4. KittyDetails

## Instruction
1. Main screen has 2 buttons:
  * KittyList
  * RandomKitty
  User can navigate either to RandomKitty or KittyList
2. RandomKitty has an UIImageView and a button.
 User gets a random image of a kitty from the API, can click refresh button to get another random Image. 
 When user clicks on the image will be displayed in full size. User can also zoom the picture.
3. KittyList is a UITableView with a list of all cat breeds.
A table with all kitty breeds from the API. User can search breeds by the country/origin.
The initial idea was also to have a [picture](https://github.com/Falliot/KittyPaw/blob/master/Test%20Task/Screenshots/KittyListScreen.png) of the kitty in the tableView. However, it was removed in the very end of the development, due to demanding requirements.(It works nice with very high internet speed)
4. KittyDetails with the details of a particular breed.
User can take a look at breed details. He/She can interact with an image in the same way as in RandomKitty Screen. If user wants some more info about the breed, he/she can click on Wikipedia button
